# Character-Based Embeddings for Large Language Models
Overview

This repository contains Python code for generating character-based embeddings for words, particularly designed for use in Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT, etc. It focuses on creating a fundamental layer of word representation through simple yet effective methods, using character-level information.
About the Code

    create_embedding: This function reads a text and converts each word into a vector based on character embeddings. The embeddings for each character are sourced from a predefined dictionary, alphabet, mapping individual characters to their corresponding numeric representations.
    normalize_embedding: This function takes the generated embeddings and normalizes them to a scale of -1 to 1. This is crucial for ensuring consistent value ranges across different inputs, which is particularly beneficial for LLMs during their training and inference stages.

Usage

The code is structured to be adaptable. It reads a text file, processes it into lowercase words, and then converts these words into embeddings based on the alphabet dictionary. The embeddings are then normalized for further use.
Potential Applications

    Pre-processing step for LLMs: This can be a valuable tool for initial text processing before feeding data into more complex language models.
    Educational and Experimental Purposes: Ideal for those who wish to understand the basics of word embeddings and their normalization.

Future Work

    Integration with advanced NLP pipelines.
    Expansion to support more complex and sophisticated embedding techniques.

Getting Started
